    You'll want to party it up when you see giant gift boxes circle in front of Cinderella Castle â€” their presence means the shindig is about to begin.
    Use your camera to capture yourself as you bust a move in the middle of the celebration.
    And be sure to use the tag #MoveitShakeitPics on your posts to keep the digital party going!
