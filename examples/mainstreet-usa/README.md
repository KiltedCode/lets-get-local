This code example demonstrates how to integrate localization into your Angular web application.

The [master](https://github.com/KiltedCode/lets-get-local/tree/master) angular-internationalization is a base example application.

The [angular-internationalization](https://github.com/KiltedCode/lets-get-local/tree/angular-internationalization) branch demonstrates using the build localization tools provided by Angular. It creates compiled version of the application based on the locale. It currently supports English and Portuguese. When running the Portuguese version serves from `/pt-br`.

The [ngx-translate](https://github.com/KiltedCode/lets-get-local/tree/ngx-translate) branch demonstrates using the ngx-translate library to provide dynamic translation of the application. The application is served up and will dynamically select the language based on the browser language. It currently supports English and Portuguese.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
