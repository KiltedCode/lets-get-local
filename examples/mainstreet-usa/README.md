This code example demonstrates how to integrate localization into your Angular web application.

The [angular-internationalization](https://github.com/KiltedCode/lets-get-local/tree/angular-internationalization) branch demonstrates using the build localization tools provided by Angular. It creates compiled version of the application based on the locale. It currently supports English and Portuguese.

## Development server

To serve the English locale, run `ng serve --configuration=en`. Navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/).

To serve the Portuguese locale, run `ng serve --configuration=pt-br`. Navigate to [http://localhost:4200/pt-br](http://localhost:4200/pt-br).
