The [ngx-translate](https://github.com/KiltedCode/lets-get-local/tree/ngx-translate) branch demonstrates using the ngx-translate library to provide dynamic translation of the application. The application is served up and will dynamically select the language based on the browser language. It currently supports English and Portuguese.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. To view the application in Portuguese, update your browser locale.
